## Fix common stability issues in Cypress end-to-end tests

If you’ve ever used Cypress, you know it makes writing tests fun and enjoyable. That said, whenever dealing with e2e tests, flakiness is hard to avoid. Tackling issues connected with unstable DOM, network or the test itself takes away a lot from that enjoyment. This course hopes to bring back the fun by explaining how to tackle common stability issues in your end-to-end tests. You will learn about Cypress commands and how they can help you make your tests stable without submitting to using explicit waiting, [that are just no good](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/best-practices#Unnecessary-Waiting).

### What you’ll learn
- How to retry a test
- How to work around common DOM issues
- How to deal with slow server in your tests
- How can Cypress’ retryability help you out in various situations
- How to fix situations where your input loses focus, or click is not registered properly
- and some more

### Why was this course created?
Due to simple implementation of Cypress into the workflow, it is often easy to skip over some of the Cypress fundamentals. In it’s core, Cypress is built to make your tests flake-free. That’s why it’s very valuable to understand how you can leverage retryabilty, command chaining and other core-concepts. These can help immensely when trying to write stable tests. If you ever experienced your test passing and failing randomly, this course will provide some answers.
